# Brief
Shows each grade category and allows user to enter in grades and create results, the user then can, after calculating all the grades, continue to the home tab and calculate the overall grade for that said subject.

# Overview
Uses the Qt interface, such as GridLayout, QHBoxLayout, and more layout features to create a Gui so the user can easily determine grades without having to do it on a piece of paper. It uses basic c++ skills and Qt libraries to accomplish. Future reference, using the Qt ui is the most beneficial and effeicient way to create gui system

# System Runs
Have used in Qt only and worked on windows, should still work on linux and apple machines.
